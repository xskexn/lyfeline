⭐ Lyfeline ⭐

A life gamification system inspired by:

Solo Leveling: For the motivation to never stop progressing. 📈

Atomic Habits: For the knowledge that small steps lead to massive change. ✨

Built on the Japanese principle of Kaizen, Lyfeline challenges the player to make continuous, tiny daily improvements. As they level up, the system gets harder, forcing them to grow at a faster rate and achieve bigger goals. 🎮
